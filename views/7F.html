    <div class="row">
      <h2>Have you ever thought what would've happened if the shop keeper was unjusted to the customer? That is when the
        Consumer Forum kicks in.</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Consumer Court India</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (COPRA) was passed by the Indian parliament and came into force on December
        1986. The Act was passed to protect the consumersâ€™ interest as well as to establish state bodies to deal with
        consumer problems and anything that arises thereof.</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Consumer courts were established as Consumer Dispute Resolution Agencies and they deal with consumer disputes,
        conflicts and grievances. It is a forum where a consumer may file a case against a seller in the case where the
        consumer feels that he has been cheated or exploited by the seller. The point of having a separate forum for
        consumer disputes is to ensure that such disputes are speedily resolved and make is less expensive.</h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Types of Consumer Courts</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>COPRA provides for the formation of consumer courts, under the Act there are three tiers of Consumer Courts
        they are as follows:

        District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF):

        The DCDRF operates at a district level and takes on any consumer dispute where the appellants claim for
        compensation does not exceed 20 lakh rupees.

        State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC):

        The SCDRC operates at a state level and takes on any consumer dispute where the appellants claim for
        compensation exceeds the amount of 20 lakhs but does not exceed 1 crore rupees.

        National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (NCDRC):

        The NCDRC is the apex court and takes on any consumer dispute where the appellants claim for compensation
        exceeds the amount of 1 crore rupees.

      </h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>The jurisdictions of the courts are based on the hierarchy of the courts;

        1. Pecuniary Jurisdiction:

        The District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum has the pecuniary jurisdiction of up to an amount that does not
        exceed 20 lakhs.
        The State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has the pecuniary jurisdiction where the claim exceeds 20 lakhs
        but does not exceed 1 crore rupees.
        The Nation Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has the pecuniary jurisdiction where the claim exceeds the
        amount of 1 crore rupees.
        2. Territorial Jurisdiction:

        Territorial jurisdiction is to be taken into consideration after establishing pecuniary jurisdiction. A
        complaint may be filed in the court that is within those local limits where;

        When the opposite party voluntarily resides in or works in those local limits.
        Where the cause of action arises from.
        To determine where the cause of action arises you can apply the same laws applicable to contract law.

        Territorial jurisdiction when a transaction was done online.
        Transactions done online effectively negates territorial jurisdiction. In this case, territorial jurisdiction is
        in any of the multiple places the cause of action arises, which also includes where the appellant resides.

        3. Appellate Jurisdiction:
        <br>
        <br>

        <ul>
          <li>If a consumer is not satisfied by the decision made by the district forum they may make an appeal to the
            state commission.</li>
          <br>
          <li>If the consumer is aggrieved by the decision made by the state commission they may appeal to the national
            commission.</li>
          <br>
          <li>If a consumer is not satisfied by the decision made by the national commission they may approach the
            Supreme Court for an appeal</li>
          <br>
